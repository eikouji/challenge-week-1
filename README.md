# Challenge Week 1

## A refactor project to make Horiseon accessible to any user needing to browse the internet using screen readers.

## Semantic tags in place.
  * <header> and <footer>
  * heading tags like h1, h2, etc, are in correct sequential order.
  
## CSS Consolidation
  * repeat code reduced down to .class, .class2, .class3 {}
  * common or repeating colors and font families refered as var () in universal parameters rather than being re-written multiple times.
