# Challenge Week 1

## A refactor project to make Horiseon accessible to any user needing to browse the internet using screen readers.

## Semantic tags in place.
  * <header> and <footer>
  * heading tags like h1, h2, etc, are in correct sequential order.
  
## CSS Consolidation
  * repeat code reduced down to .class, .class2, .class3 {}
  * common or repeating colors and font families referred as var () in universal parameters rather than being re-written multiple times.

## Added Section Comments to HTML and CSS Page
  * comments were missing, not offering any visual space in the HTML or CSS files. No delineation of which CSS rules applied to which HTML elements. Now everything is commented to indicate what is what and where everything is.
